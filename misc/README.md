Some extra failes and figures:

- bestModel = the AA model chosen for each gene
- filter-lb-aa	and filter-lb-fna2aa	= the name of sequences filtered by long branch filtering
- pTpP_GC_box.pdf and names.csv	= the GC content of species for all codon positions and the name of species used in pTpP_GC_box.pdf	
   - Drawn using plot.gc.R
- taxon-occupancy.png = taxon occupancy
