We made an attempt to make trees restricted to smaller parts of the big tree for enhanced visualization. For 6 groups, Sean Graham made visually pleasing trees manually, shown below:

- [Gymnosperms](Gymnosperms_phylowiki_fig.pdf)
- [Hornworts](Hornworts_phylowiki_fig.pdf)
- [Liverworts](Liverworts_phylowiki_fig.pdf)
- [Lycophytes](Lycophytes_phylowiki_fig.pdf)
- [Monilophytes](Monilophytes_phylowiki_fig.pdf)
- [Mosses](Mosses_phylowiki_fig.pdf)

For other groups, we used automatic tools to create pdf files that are not quite as visually please but may still prove very useful. We provide here for completeness.
We provide these group-specific pdf files (and the corresponding newick tree) for [ASTRAL](astral), [concatenation](CA), and  [plastid](plastic) analyses.
