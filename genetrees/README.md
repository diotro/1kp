Here, we keep all the alternative gene trees.

The main analyses of the paper all used the FAA gene trees, given here.

- Best.FAA.tre: fully resolved best ML gene trees computed by RAxML on FAA alignments
- Best.[N].FAA.tre: best ML gene trees on FAA alignments contracted  to remove branches with below N% support
- Best.FNA2AA-C12.tre: fully resolved best ML gene trees computed by RAxML on FNA-2AA-C12 alignments


The following are filtered gene trees and also supergene trees obtained from statistical bining:

- binned/Best.FAA.binned.tre                 
- binned/Best.FNA2AA-C12.binned.tre          
- filtered/Best.eudicotrsonly.FAA.tre        
- filtered/Best.eudicotrsonly.FNA2AA-C12.tre 
- filtered/Best.removerogoue.FAA.tre
- filtered/Best.removerogoue.FNA2AA-C12.tre
